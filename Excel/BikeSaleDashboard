Setup: To start the project, data cleaning was performed to ensure accurate analysis. This included the removal of duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset. Furthermore, the data was updated to be more interpretable, such as replacing "m" and "f" with "male" and "female", and "m" and "s" with "married" and "single". Age groups were also created to facilitate better visualization of the data. Additionally, I ensured there was no missing data and that each field had the correct data type.

Key insights:

What is the most common age group of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common gender of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common income range of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common education level of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common occupation of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common region of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
What is the most common commute distance of customers who purchase bikes from the shop?
Does the marital status of customers have any correlation with the likelihood of purchasing a bike from the shop?
Data exploration I used the customer data to create pivot tables that grouped the customers based on different criteria. Using these groups, I created charts that show key insights. Additionally, differnt functions were used to perform calculations.

To make it easy to view all this information at once, I created a dashboard that displays all the charts. I also added a slicer to the dashboard, which allows users to filter the data based on different criteria. This makes it easy to identify the customer segments that are most likely to purchase a bike.

Conclusion: 

The largest group of bike purchasers is aged 31-50. Most have partial high school education and work in management. North America is the leading region for bike sales, with purchasers typically commuting 0-1 mile. They usually own 0-1 cars and do not have children. Married customers are more likely to buy bikes, likely due to higher combined incomes, while home ownership does not significantly impact bike purchasing.
